# Practice Time

## What is this for?

It's just for practice!

## Why do we practice?

- So we can get better!
- The more we practice, the more familiar we get, and everything feels easier!

## What does the green bar on the left mean?

I think that means these are the lines that have been changed since this file was last pushed to github

## Did it do what I thought it would?

No, it's actually only the changes on the local machine in VS Code since the last commit. Github has nothing to do with it.
